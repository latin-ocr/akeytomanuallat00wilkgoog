PREFACE.

—400——

ΟΝ publishing a new edition of this Key‚ it was found, for

several reasons, desirable to print the passages translated in
Parts Ι. and V. in full, instead of merely giving references
to them.

Every translation in Parts ΙΙ. and IV. is signed with the
Translator’s name 3 except in the case of some versions,
whose authorship I am not at liberty to mention, from the
‘ Letters ’ of J UMUS. They were taken down at a Composi-
tion Lecture‚ given by one of the Tutors of Balliol college,
whose courtesy allows their publication here. For the
translations signed ⁶ W.' the author is responsible.

Mna-ron Gonnos, Onon:
June, 1883.
